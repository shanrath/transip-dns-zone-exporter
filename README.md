# TransIP DNS Zone Exporter | Export Your TransIP DNS domain Zones Easily

The **TransIP DNS Zone Exporter** is a PHP command-line tool for exporting DNS zone data from a TransIP domain. This tool was created to make it easier to transfer a zone to another DNS provider, such as Cloudflare. It can also be used to backup your DNS zone data.

## Prerequisites

To use this tool, you will need to have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and [PHP](https://www.php.net/) installed on your system.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal.
3. Run the following command to install the dependencies:

```sh
composer install
```

## Configuration

Before running the tool, you will need to set your TransIP username, domains or tags set on the domains, and API key in the `config.php` file.
There is a example file called `config.example.php` in the root directory of the project. You can use this file as your starting point.


## Usage

To run the tool, use the following command in your terminal:

```sh
php index.php
```

After the command has completed, you should see a file with the name `[domain name].zone` in the zonefiles directory of the project. This file contains your DNS zone data in BIND format.

## Export Efficiency with Tagged Domains

Tagging domains in TransIP streamlines organization. Rather than manually typing each domain, simply configure the desired tags in config.php to export grouped domains efficiently. Saves time, ensures accuracy.

## Simplified Export of Domain Authorization (transfer) Codes

Enabling the exportAuthorizationCodes setting in the configuration file facilitates exporting authorization codes for each domain. These codes are essential for domain transfers. This streamlines the process by allowing bulk export of authorization codes. However, please note that this functionality is contingent upon the domain's TLD supporting authorization codes and the domain being transferable.

## Conclusion

Using the **TransIP DNS Zone Exporter** can save you a lot of time when transferring your DNS zone to another provider or backing up your data. I hope you find this tool useful!

Im open to PR's and suggestions to improve this tool.
